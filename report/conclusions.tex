We observe three things:

1. For small sampling costs relative to the duration of the transect the foraging algorithm produces about a 50\% reduction in accumulated error.

2. When the sampling cost is large relative to the duration of the transect Uniform sampling is as good as or better than foraging.  This makes sense.  The early samples are the most informative.  By making sure you distribute the samples across the different classes of objects increases
