- Figure results.1: Overall error at the end of the trial with unlimited sampling and without weighing by the rarity (1/prob of occurrence) of the class
- Figure results.2: overall error at the end of the trial with unlimited sampling and with weighing by the rarity of the class
- Figure results.3: Overall performance when combining limited time and limited sample budgets.
