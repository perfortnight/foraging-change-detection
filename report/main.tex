This paper presents a new algorithm for autonomous on-line exploration in unknown environments.  The objective of the algorithm is to free robot scientists from extensive preliminary site investigation while still being able to collect meaningful data.  We simulate a common form of exploration task for an autonomous robot involving sampling the environment at various locations and compare performance with a simpler existing algorithm that is also denied global information.  The result of the experiment shows that the new algorithm has a statistically significant improvement in performance with a significant effect size for a range of costs for taking sampling actions.
